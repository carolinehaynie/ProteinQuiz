          <p>
            Providers are generous and selfless. They give what they can to those in need, often putting others first.
            Similarly, hemoglobin can be thought of as a provider protein in the human body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen
            from the lungs to various tissues throughout the body. Hemoglobin is a tetramer: it has four protein subunits
            folded together in a quaternary structure that form a circular ring arrangement. Each protein subunit contains one heme, which is a molecule that holds iron.
            That iron binds oxygen in the lungs, making hemoglobin the primary delivery service for one of the body’s most
            vital resources. Without it, cells couldn’t perform their essential functions. In this way, hemoglobin provides
            for the entire body.
          </p>

          <p>
            Managers are organizers. They coordinate complex systems, delegate tasks, and keep everything running smoothly. Similarly, histones are responsible for managing genetic information in a cell.
            Histone proteins are shaped to form a spool-like core, around which DNA wraps to form chromatin. This compaction is not just for
            storage—it controls access to genes. Histone H3 has a flexible tail that sticks out and can be chemically modified, altering how
            tightly DNA is wound. These structural tweaks change which genes are exposed or hidden, controlling the flow of genetic information.
            It's precision management at the molecular level.
          </p>
          <div class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but histones can compact this into about 0.09 millimeters.</div>

          <p>
            Architects are planners and builders. They’re detail-oriented and love turning blueprints into reality. Polymerases perform a similar function in the cell.
            These enzymes have intricate active sites shaped to match specific nucleotide bases. As they move along a DNA or RNA strand,
            their shape shifts to guide the assembly of a new polymer. Structural changes ensure only the correct pieces are added,
            making the final product highly accurate. Polymerases read genetic code and build the foundational chains of life—one careful step at a time.

          <p>
            Athletes thrive on motion, strength, and discipline. They’re always in action—just like myosin. Myosin has a distinct head domain
            that binds to actin filaments and a tail that anchors it to cargo or structures. The head uses ATP to change shape, swinging like a
            lever to “walk” along actin. This shape-shifting mechanism—called the power stroke—is what powers muscle contraction and cellular transport.
            It’s a protein built for movement.
          </p>
          <div class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Longer myosin proteins can move muscle farther per power stroke—just like people with long legs can move farther with each step.</div>

          <p>
            Guardians protect what matters most. They’re responsible, vigilant, and ready to act. p53 plays a similar role in our cells.
            It's often called the “guardian of the genome” because of its role in preventing cancer. p53 is a transcription factor with a highly
            specific DNA-binding domain shaped to recognize damage response genes. When DNA is damaged, p53 steps in. It can pause the cell cycle,
            repair the DNA, or—if the damage is beyond repair—initiate cell death (apoptosis). This keeps mutations from spreading and protects
            the integrity of the organism.

          <p>
            Warriors are defenders—loyal, brave, and quick to act. Immunoglobulins (AKA antibodies) are the immune system’s elite guards.
            These Y-shaped proteins have flexible arms with highly variable tips that are fine-tuned to bind specific antigens. This structural
            adaptability lets each antibody target a unique threat. Once bound, they signal other immune cells to take action. Their precision
            and structure are what make them such formidable protectors.

          <p>
            Thinkers are careful, analytical decision-makers. The NMDA receptor in the brain works similarly by controlling how neurons connect
            and strengthen through experience. Structurally, it’s a multi-subunit protein that acts like a gatekeeper. It only opens when it
            receives specific signals, allowing ions to flow into the neuron, which strengthens connections for learning and memory. However,
            if overstimulated, it can cause damage, just like a thinker overwhelmed by too much information.
          </p>
          <div class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Activity of NMDA is blocked by pyschoactive drugs such as alcohol.</div>

          <p>
            Entertainers dazzle and inspire. They shine—literally, in the case of luciferase. Luciferase has a specialized binding pocket that
            reacts with a molecule called luciferin to produce light. Luciferase is the enzyme responsible for bioluminescence in living organisms. It catalyzes a reaction that produces light by using a luciferin cofactor to make a very energetic complex with oxygen. When this complex breaks, light is emitted. Scientists have
            harnessed luciferase for research, using its glow to track gene expression and visualize molecular events in real time.
